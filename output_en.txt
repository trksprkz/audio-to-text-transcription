 Hi and welcome. My name is Manoj. I'm a meditation teacher and co-founder of Open. And welcome to today's meditation practice. What we're actually going to do is we're trying to generate feelings of kindness, acceptance, warmth and tenderness for us off. And this is a very ancient practice. The 2,500 year old practice often referred to as meta meditation. So I'll invite you to settle into a comfortable position. You can lay down if you wish if that's most comfortable for you. You can even do this standing up if that feels good. But I love to do this seated. And as you sit, you may wish to lengthen your spine so it's upright and alert without being rigid or forced. You can place both your palms down on top of your thighs or you can place some on top of each other. And when you're ready, let's take a deep breath in together, in through the nose, out through the mouth, breathing in deeply. And then as you open your mouth, relax your shoulders. You begin to just settle into your meditation today. You don't have to control your breathing. You don't have to force your mind to be quiet. Just take a moment as you settle into your practice. Just notice that you have a body. This awareness of our body can allow us to feel more present with it. Notice any sounds that are around you. You don't have to wonder what they are or why they're here. Just notice that sounds come and go. And then begin to notice your heart. And take a moment to remember that you have a heart. And that heart is breathing. And that heart is feeling. As you keep your awareness here, I'm going to invite you to begin to visualize an image of yourself. You can visualize yourself as you are right now. Or if it's helpful, you can visualize yourself as a child. As you visualize yourself, mentally repeat these phrases. May I be happy. And as you repeat that phrase in your mind, it's not important to see if you're feeling happy. It's not important who was there or what happened. We're really recollect the feeling of being happy. And then mentally keep repeating that phrase. May I be happy. And then repeat the phrase. May I be safe. And as you mentally repeat this phrase, remember a time when you felt safe. And again, the occasion of the people that were around you aren't as important as the feeling of safety. May I be safe. As you repeat this phrase, notice how it feels in your body. The intention, creating the feeling. And then for yourself the phrase, may I be healthy. And this is your heartfelt wish to be healthy in the mind and healthy in the body. And you can bring to mind a time when you felt that way. And then repeat the phrase. May I live with ease. And remember a time when you lived with ease. Notice how this feels in your body. and As you systematically mentally repeat these phrases, notice what is being felt in your body. Often this feeling that we are feeling is called metta, loving kindness. It's an acceptance, it's a warm heartedness and it's a tenderness for ourselves. As if you sink into that feeling, it's for a few more moments. As if you are feeling the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain one man, just take the distance of the mind, then with your mind, just made a difference, it's Notice how your body feels. And perhaps make an intention to take with you into the rest of your day. The same quality of matter of loving kindness for us off. When you're ready, you can very gently begin to open your eyes. Thank you for joining me today. I'll see you again next time.
